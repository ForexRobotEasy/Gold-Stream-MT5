# Gold Stream - Forex Robot

## Description

Gold Stream is a secure gold trading software developed by an independent developer. This Forex robot is designed to trade gold in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses a custom indicator to identify trends and determine entry and exit points for trades.

The robot has two input parameters, StopLoss and TakeProfit, which allow the user to set the desired stop loss and take profit levels in pips. The robot will calculate the appropriate stop loss and take profit levels based on the current price and the input parameters.

The indicator buffers are registered and set in the custom indicator initialization function. The indicator labels are also set in this function.

In the custom indicator iteration function, the trend direction is calculated based on the previous two closing prices. If there is a trend and the volume has changed since the last trade, a trade is placed based on the trend direction.

For a buy trade, the stop loss and take profit levels are calculated and the trade is placed using the OrderSend function. If the trade is placed successfully, the robot continues to monitor the market. If there is an error placing the trade, an error message is printed.

For a sell trade, the stop loss and take profit levels are calculated in the opposite direction, and the trade is placed using the OrderSend function. The same error handling process is followed.

The last known price and volume are updated after each iteration.
